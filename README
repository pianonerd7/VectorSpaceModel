Dictionary - 
Can create another data structure to represent every dictionary node, 
but want to keep it simple. Another alternative is to use the tuple
data structure, but tuples in python are immutable, and since we will be doing
a lot of writing and updating, that seems very inefficient. Resorted to using
a list of size 2 to represent each dictionary entry.
